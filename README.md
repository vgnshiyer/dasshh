### Using `uv` (Recommended)

If you haven't tried [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) yet, it's highly recommended for fast Python package management.

```bash
# Install uv on macOS
brew install uv

# Or using curl
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dasshh
uv tool install dasshh
```

### Using `pipx`

```bash
# Install pipx if you haven't already
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install dasshh
pipx install dasshh
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
dasshh --version
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

```bash
dasshh init-config
```

This creates a config file at `~/.dasshh/config.yaml`.

### 2. Configure Your Model

Edit the config file to set your model and API key:

```yaml
model:
  name: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
  api_key: <your-google-AI-studio-api-key>
```

> See [litellm docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for all supported models and providers.

### 3. Launch Dasshh

```bash
dasshh
```

### 4. Start Chatting

Ask Dasshh to help with system tasks:

```
‚Ä¢ What's the current CPU usage?
‚Ä¢ Show me the top memory-intensive processes  
‚Ä¢ List files in my downloads folder
‚Ä¢ Create a new directory called "projects"
```

**Exit:** Press `Ctrl+C` to terminate.
