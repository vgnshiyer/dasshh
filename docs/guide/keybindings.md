# Keybindings

## Current Keybindings

Dasshh currently supports a minimal set of keyboard shortcuts:

| Key Combination | Action |
| --------------- | ------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> | Quit the application |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> | Change theme |

## Future Plans

More customizable keybindings are currently in development and will be added in future releases. These will include:

- Navigation shortcuts
- Message editing shortcuts
- Session management shortcuts
- Vim based text interactions
- Customizable user-defined keybindings

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance the keyboard navigation experience in Dasshh.

If you have suggestions for specific keybindings you'd like to see implemented, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vgnshiyer/dasshh/issues) on our GitHub repository.
