# Welcome to Dasshh!

## What is Dasshh?

Dasshh is an open-source terminal-based AI assistant that allows you to interact with your computer using natural language. It's designed to save your cognitive energy by enabling you to accomplish repetitive tasks on your computer with simple, conversational commands.

Instead of remembering arcane command-line syntax or navigating complex directory structures, Dasshh lets you describe what you want to do in plain English, and it handles the technical details for you.

Moreover, you can add your own tools to Dasshh to make it even more powerful, allowing it to interact with your applications and services.

## Technical Foundation

Dasshh is built using several powerful Python libraries:

- [**Textual**](https://textual.textualize.io/) - The modern TUI (Text User Interface) framework that powers Dasshh's beautiful terminal interface
- [**LiteLLM**](https://docs.litellm.ai/) - Provides the AI model connection layer, making it easy to work with various LLM providers
- [**SQLAlchemy**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - Manages persistent data storage for chat history and application state
- [**Click**](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) - Powers the command-line interface for Dasshh

## Development Status

Dasshh is currently in early development. While it already offers valuable functionality, we're actively working on expanding its capabilities, improving stability, and enhancing the user experience.

We welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community to help shape the future of Dasshh.
